To use lighting control software like [QLC+](http://www.qlcplus.org/), [DMXControl](https://www.dmxcontrol.org/) or [e:cue](http://www.ecue.de/), you need fixture definition files that describe your lighting hardware. Since one software can usually only understand its own fixture definition format, switching between different programs can be difficult.

The *Open Fixture Library* ([open-fixture-library.herokuapp.com](https://open-fixture-library.herokuapp.com/)) tries to solve this problem by collecting fixture definitions and making them downloadable in various formats. Internally, it uses a [JSON format](fixtures/schema.js) that tries to bundle as much information as possible for all the different output formats.


## Contribute

The project is still in a very early stage, but we're happy to see new issues or pull requests anyway!

Pushing to the `master` branch here on GitHub deploys a new version on [Heroku](http://heroku.com/) each time. So we have to make sure that the `master` branch is always clean and ready to deploy. Thus, we will make heavy use of pull requests (so, do always create feature branches `git checkout -b new-feature`) and let [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/FloEdelmann/open-fixture-library) check that everything new is passing all tests.


### Local installation

1. Clone this repository (or a fork of it).
2. Run `npm install` after first cloning or every time new dependencies are added in [package.json](package.json) in order to install the needed Node dependencies. (You can identify missing dependencies when the error "Cannot find module" is given.)
3. To start the server locally at [localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000/), run `npm start` or `npm run watch` (to restart the server everytime a file is changed).


### New fixtures

Ideally, just use the [Fixture Editor](https://open-fixture-library.herokuapp.com/fixture-editor) and submit it from there (however, some features are still missing, see [#77](https://github.com/FloEdelmann/open-fixture-library/issues/77)). Please try to include as much information as possible!

If you have to manually edit fixtures, see [schema.js](fixtures/schema.js) in the `fixtures` directory and use the existing fixtures as a reference.

You can also import existing fixture definitions using import plugins. See [cli/import-fixture.js](cli/import-fixture.js) for that. In the future, this will be integrated into the Fixture Editor.


### Fixture features

See [cli/fixture-features/README.md](cli/fixture-features/README.md).


### Model

A fixture is internally modeled in the [Fixture](lib/model/Fixture.js) class. An object (parsed from the JSON file) provides additional functionalities to ease the handling and to avoid code duplication. See the files in the [lib/model/ directory](lib/model/) to see possible fuctions. All the properties from the JSON are available in the model with their respective names though.


### Plugins

A plugin is a module that handles import from and/or export to a fixture format. To add a plugin, create a new subdirectory in the `plugins` directory containing the following files:

* `README.md`: A markdown file with a short explanation about the fixture format. If applicable, please include:
    * a link to the software that uses this format
    * how to import fixtures into the software
    * a place where fixtures of this format can be obained from
* `export.js` if export is supported.
  ```js
  module.exports.name = 'Plugin Name';
  module.exports.version = '0.0.1';  // semantic versioning of export plugin

  module.exports.export = function exportPluginName(fixtures, options) {
    /*
    * fixtures: array of Fixture objects
    * 
    * options: {
    *   baseDir: '...',
    *   // maybe more
    * }
    */

    let outfiles = [];

    // ...

    // multiple files will automatically be zipped together
    outfiles.push({
      name: 'filename.ext',
      content: 'file content',
      mimetype: 'text/plain'
    });

    // ...

    return outfiles;
  };
  ```
* `import.js` if import is supported.
  ```js
  module.exports.name = 'Plugin Name';
  module.exports.version = '0.1.0';  // semantic versioning of import plugin

  module.exports.import = function importPluginName(str, filename, resolve, reject) {
    /*
    * str:      'import file contents'
    * filename: 'importFilename.ext'
    * resolve:  function to call if everything goes right, see below
    * reject:   function to call if something goes wrong, see below
    */

    let out = {
      manufacturers: {},  // like in manufacturers.json
      fixtures: {},       // key: 'manufacturer-key/fixture-key', value: like in a fixture JSON
      warnings: {}        // key: 'manufacturer-key/fixture-key' to which a warning belongs, value: string
    };

    // ...

    // example
    const manKey = 'cameo';
    const fixKey = 'thunder-wash-600-rgb'

    if (couldNotParse) {
      return reject(`Could not parse '${filename}'.`);
    }

    // Add warning if a necessary property is not included in parsed file
    out.warnings[manKey + '/' + fixKey].push('Could not parse categories, please specify them manually.');

    out.fixtures[manKey + '/' + fixKey] = fixtureObject;

    resolve(out);
  };
  ```

You can try plugins from the commandline:

```
node cli/import-fixture.js <plugin> <filename>
node cli/export-fixture.js -p <plugin name> <fixture> [<more fixtures>]
```


### UI

Static files are located in the `static` directory (surprise!), the dynamic stuff is in `views`.

The `views/stylesheets` subfolder contains the SASS stylesheets. Try to keep them organized, feel free to add a new file if needed.

We use [Express](http://expressjs.com/) to handle and delegate web requests to the respective page modules. Those templates reside in the `views/pages` subdirectory. A template module has to export a single function that returns a string which will be treated as HTML. The function receives a single `options` parameter. See [main.js](main.js#L59) for the guaranteed options.


### Tests

Every time a new commit is pushed to GitHub, [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/FloEdelmann/open-fixture-library) runs all the tests in the `tests` directory (configured by [.travis.yml](.travis.yml)). That helps spotting bugs early.

Additionally, [Codacy](https://www.codacy.com/app/FloEdelmann/open-fixture-library) helps with static code analysis.

We want to ensure good code style and fixture validity, so if you have an idea for a new test or on how to improve an existing one â€“ awesome!
