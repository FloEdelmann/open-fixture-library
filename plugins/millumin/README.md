# Millumin Plugin

<http://www.millumin.com>

Output fixtures for the Mac OS software *Millumin 2*. The format is essentially [the OFL format at schema version 7.0.0](https://github.com/OpenLightingProject/open-fixture-library/blob/schema-7.0.0/docs/fixture-format.md), with a few additional properties: Fixture and manufacturer keys and a link to the OFL fixture page.

### File locations

Fixtures should be copied into the `~/Library/Millumin/` folder (`~` is the user's home directory). You can keep them inside their manufacturer subfolder.

Restarting the software is necessary to apply changes.
