# QLC+ v5 plugin

<http://www.qlcplus.org/>

A feature-rich open-source lighting software. This plugin works with QLC+ version 5 and above.

The main library is available in their [GitHub repository](https://github.com/mcallegari/qlcplus/tree/master/resources/fixtures). Many additional fixtures can be found in the [forum](http://www.qlcplus.org/forum/viewforum.php?f=3). To create a new fixture, the `Fixture Editor` program is also included.

To import a fixture into *QLC+*, copy the `.qxf` file into the right directory (see below).

**File locations:**

Fixtures are always located in the `fixture` subdirectory in one of the following paths. Fixtures can be grouped in subdirectories (e.g. by manufacturer).
