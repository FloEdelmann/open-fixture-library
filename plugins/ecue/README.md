# e:cue plugin

<http://www.ecue.com/>

The [e:cue Lighting Application Suite](http://www.ecue.com/index.php?id=502) outputs DMX via *e:net*, a proprietary network protocol only understood by *e:cue*'s *Butler* dongles.

A large (but a bit outdated) library is included. Some fixtures are available from their [Support Forum](http://www.ecue.com/no_cache/forum.html?tx_mmforum_pi1%5Baction%5D=list_topic&tx_mmforum_pi1%5Bfid%5D=11). New fixtures can be created in the *Library Editor* program, from which other fixtures can also be imported.

**File locations:**
*User Library:* `C:\Documents and Settings\[Your User]\AppData\Local\ecue\Library V7.0\UserLibrary.xml`  
*Main Library:* `C:\ProgramData\ecue\Library V7.0\MainLibrary.xml`
