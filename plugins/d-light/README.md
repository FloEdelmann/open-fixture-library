# D::Light plugin

<https://getdlight.com/en/>

A lighting software available for Windows, Mac and Linux.

- There are around 80 fixture definitions (device personalities) available [here](https://getdlight.com/en/devices-en)
- They're stored in the encrypted binary format `.dll`, but D::Light will also support using non-encrypted fixtures in `.xml` format
- Some decrypted fixtures in xml format:
  - **_Robe Robin 600 LEDWash (mode2)_**: <https://pastebin.com/BGmwK1Tw>
  - **_[Showtec Phantom 50 (13ch)](http://open-fixture-library.herokuapp.com/showtec/phantom-50-led-spot)_**: <https://pastebin.com/QCRa86Xr>

-> Export is possible as the syntax is clear, import would only make sense if the developers imported the decrypted fixtures
