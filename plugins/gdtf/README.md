# GDTF plugin

<https://gdtf-share.com/>

GDTF was originally conceived and jointly developed by *MA Lighting*, *Robe*, and *Vectorworks*.

The file format is developed to be an open standards technology and manufacturers involved in the entertainment design, production, and performance industry are welcomed to participate in supporting GDTF.

The GDTF file format is [openly available](https://gdtf-share.com/wiki/GDTF_File_Description).

Since many manufacturers won't ever provide their fixture definitions in GDTF and many lighting programs (including legacy ones) won't ever understand them, the Open Fixture Library with this plugin is still needed ;)
