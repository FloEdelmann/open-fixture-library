  "comment": "The Sunstrip Active DMX MKII is a powerful device and the successor to the popular Showtec Sunstrip Active. For added flexibility and the option of more application usages, a selection of DMX modes can be chosen from: 1 channel, 2 channels, 5 channels and 10 channels. For stand-alone applications, the Sunstrip Active is equipped with 16 built-in patterns as well as a manual dimmer. With the Neutrik power twist in- and outputs, the Sunstrip is also ideal for more demanding on-the-road purposes. Easy to install, it is equipped with two wall / floor brackets, as well as several M10 nuts to position the clamp in the desired position.",
