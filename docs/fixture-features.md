# Fixture features

Fixture features are specific [fixture](fixture-format.md) characteristics (like "uses RDM" or "uses fine channel before coarse channel"), especially ones that have produced or are likely to produce bugs and errors.

We use fixture features for the following purposes:
- Generate a minimal collection of test fixtures that cover all fixture features so we can check all special cases with minimum work
- *(planned)* The fixture editor can only edit / import fixtures that only use editor-compatible fixture features
- *(planned)* Search for fixtures with specific fixture features (mainly for testing)

Fixture features are saved in the the [`lib/fixture-features/`](../lib/fixture-features/) directory as JS modules that export an array of features. It is advised to put similar features into one module. A sample module looks like this:

```js
module.exports = [{
  // Optional. Used internally and in test-fixtures.json.
  // Default is the filename (without '.js'), succeded by `-${i}` if multiple features per module are provided.
  id: 'fine-channel-alias',

  // Required. Try to be as short as possible as it's used in generated table header. Markdown is allowed.
  name: 'Fine channels (16bit)',

  // Optional. Is used as tooltip in generated table header. Markdown is not allowed.
  description: 'Whether a channel defines exactly one fine channel alias',

  // Optional. The feature with the highest order is in the first (most-left) column.
  // Default value is 0, negative values are allowed (to appear right to the features with default order).
  order: 81,

  /**
   * Required. Checks if the given fixture uses this module's feature.
   * @param {!Fixture} fixture The Fixture instance, see our model.
   * @return {!Boolean} true if fixture uses the feature
   */
  hasFeature: fixture =>
    fixture.availableChannels.some(
      channel => channel.fineChannelAliases.length === 1
    )
}];
```

Test fixtures are generated by calling `node cli/make-test-fixture.js` or simply `make`. They are saved machine-readable as [`tests/test-fixtures.json`](../tests/test-fixtures.json) and human-readable as [`tests/test-fixtures.md`](../tests/test-fixtures.md).
